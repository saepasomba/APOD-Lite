# APOD-Lite
## Introduction
APOD-Lite is an iOS application that utilizes NASA API. This app focuses on presenting APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) of the current date by default, but it's not limited by that! It can see past APOD by customizing the date. As a personal project, this app is my media to practice API consumption in SwiftUI.
